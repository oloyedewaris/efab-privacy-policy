        <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</h2>
        <p>
          We will keep your personal information only as long as is reasonably
          necessary for our legitimate business needs and to comply with legal
          requirements. For example, we may retain data until the end of a
          leasing contract, or after your query has been addressed. In certain
          cases, we may retain your personal information longer if required by
          law or regulation, or to establish, exercise, or defend our legal
          rights. When personal information is no longer needed, we will
          securely dispose of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on where and how long your personal information
          is stored—and for information on your rights of erasure and
          portability—please contact us using the details provided in

        <h2>6. HOW SECURE IS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>
          We prioritize the security of your personal data. We take measures to
          securely transmit personal information from your computer, smartphone,
          and other devices to our servers. We employ industry-standard security
          measures (e.g., firewalls, Transport Security Layer (TLS)) to keep
          your data confidential and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Policies, and procedures designed to protect your personal information
          from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
          disclosure. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Placing confidentiality requirements on our staff and service
            providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restricting access to personal information strictly to those with a
            need to know (e.g., to respond to inquiries).
          </li>
          <li>
            Destroying or anonymizing personal information when it is no longer
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using secure communication channels for transmitting personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where
          we have provided a password (or you have chosen one) for access to
          parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password
          confidential. Please do not share it with anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we strive to protect your personal information, transmission of
          information via the internet is not completely secure. Any
          transmission of personal information is at your own risk, and we are
          not responsible for unauthorized access that circumvents any privacy
          settings or security measures on our Website.

          with applicable laws. In certain situations, we may not be able to
          fully address your request, for example if it would violate another
          individual’s rights or if we are legally required to retain certain
          information.
